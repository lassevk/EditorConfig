# Readme

This repository simply contains my .editorconfig file for inclusion into other
Visual Studio 2017 projects.

Since I use ReSharper heavily I've added all the config settings that ReSharper
understands in addition to the ones I've found that Visual Studio 2017 understands.

Feel free go grab a copy of it, there's nothing proprietary here.
